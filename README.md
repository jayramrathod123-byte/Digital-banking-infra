# 🚀 Secure & Scalable Digital Banking Infrastructure (Demo Project)

This repository showcases a **DevOps Project** inspired by my experience at **Unity Small Finance Bank**, where I worked on improving **Mobile & Net Banking applications** by making them more **secure, scalable, and highly available**.  

---

## 🔑 Features Implemented
- 🌐 **Application Gateway + Web Application Firewall (WAF)** for secure traffic management.  
- ⚖️ **Load Balancer** to ensure high availability and intelligent routing.  
- 🛡️ **Bastion Host** for controlled access to production servers.  
- 🔐 **HTTPS/TLS Encryption** for secure customer transactions.  
- 👥 **RBAC & Secure Authentication** with encrypted usernames and passwords.  
- ⚡ Automated deployment pipelines with **CI/CD**.  
- 📊 Monitoring using **Prometheus + Grafana**.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone this repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/digital-banking-infra.git
   cd digital-banking-infra

   Client ---> Application Gateway (WAF) ---> Load Balancer ---> Web/App Servers
                  |                                     
                  +---> Bastion Host (Admin Access)
                  +---> HTTPS/TLS Encryption

```hcl
resource "azurerm_lb" "banking_lb" {
  name                = "banking-lb"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.rg.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name
  sku                 = "Standard"

  frontend_ip_configuration {
    name                 = "PublicIPAddress"
    public_ip_address_id = azurerm_public_ip.lb_public_ip.id
  }
}

resource "azurerm_public_ip" "lb_public_ip" {
  name                = "lb-public-ip"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.rg.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name
  allocation_method   = "Static"
  sku                 = "Standard"
